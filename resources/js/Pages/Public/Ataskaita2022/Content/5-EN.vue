            Project "Increasing the involvement of students in fostering academic ethics
            in the university community"
          </h3>
          <p>
            Academic ethics – one of the fundamental values of higher education – is
            enshrined both in the Law on Science and Studies of the Republic of Lithuania
            and in the statutes of higher education institutions, therefore it becomes an
            important duty of a higher education institution. One of the principles of
            academic ethics, academic integrity, is a particularly sensitive issue in
            higher education, the development of which must be given attention both at
            institutional and national level. In order to increase the involvement of
            students in fostering academic ethics at Vilnius University, VU SR implemented
            a project during which the training and planning of the VU SR program
            "Sąžiningai" was organized, open training courses were created in a virtual
            learning environment about academic ethics, presentations on the topic of
            academic ethics were organized for students, the issue of ensuring academic
            ethics was raised in the VU SR Parliament and the position of the organization
            was consolidated. Next, on this basis, an advocacy on the topic of academic
            ethics takes place.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Project "ECSTRA: Employability Competencies for Students Through
            implementation and Recognition of Activities"
          </h3>
          <p>
            One of the key skills needed to work and live in the 21st century is
            initiative and entrepreneurship, i.e., a person's ability to turn ideas into
            actions. We believe that higher education institutions must help students(s)
            acquire these skills, therefore, VU SR is implementing a project aimed at
            helping students(s) to acquire competences through voluntary activities,
            during which real-life problems would be solved through social innovations. In
            order to achieve this, we aim to enable communities to take the initiative and
            solve problems themselves, to develop and coordinate initiatives with a
            sustainable long-term impact, and to improve the system of recognition of
            competences acquired informally.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the basis of this project, a canvas model and template adapted for the
            development of initiatives, volunteer management guidebook, trainings for
            community coordinators, who could expand the development of initiatives in the
            institutions and countries participating in the project, guidelines for the
            system of informally acquired competences for the system of crediting of
            competences acquired in higher education institutions and crash-course content
            for future initiative managers and teams on important topics of organization
            of activities are prepared.
          </p>
          <p>
            VU SR is working on this project together with Vilnius University (VU) Jean
            Monnet University (UJM) and The University of Granada (UGR).

          <h3>
            Project "Improving public governance in the field of education by involving
            non-governmental organizations"
          </h3>
          <p>
            This year, VU SR completed the implementation of a 3-year project to improve
            public management. The essence of the project is to strengthen the activity
            and quality of representation of the organizations participating in the
            project by improving public governance in the field of education. After the
            completion of the project, it is clear that the implementation of the project
            allowed the organizations to ensure high-quality and constant representation
            of the target group at various levels during the strategic period. In the
            context of the project, 20 proposals were submitted to the responsible
            institutions regarding the improvement of the education system in Lithuania,
            12 studies and surveys were carried out and their analysis was carried out,
            and 1 set of positions was drawn up; various trainings and conferences were
            organized both for the development of competences of the members of the
            organizations and for the greater involvement of students(s). Thanks to this
            project, VU SR has already expanded the wide range of topics and issues
            affecting students(s) even more – in our activities we can rely on concrete
            and research-based data (which are often difficult or not found in external
            sources), and from them significant proposals and changes are formed for
            students(s) both at the University and national level.

          <h3>Development of VU SR Strategic Plan 2022-2025</h3>

          <p>
            This year, VU SR's Strategic Action Plan for the period 2019-2022 expires. For
            this reason, we reviewed and prepared an updated draft of strategic action
            plan for 2022-2025 in the organization. Different units of the organization
            and their members were involved in the process, and the draft of the new
            strategic action plan created by designing possible visions for the future,
            was submitted to the VU SR Parliament.
          </p>

          <h3>Culture of self-reflection</h3>

          <p>
            This year, new processes have been created in the organization, and one of
            them is the introduction of self-reflection culture. In order to improve in
            one's field and to see if the goals set have already been achieved (or perhaps
            are still being pursued), it is necessary to reflect. It is during
            self-reflections that the opportunity is given not only to evaluate yourself
            and your development process, but also to help yourself to move on. The
            above-mentioned tool is divided into two parts: questions are designed to
            evaluate yourself every few months in the organization and everyday questions
            that allow you to reflect on the activities of the day and provide an
            opportunity to improve on a daily basis.
          </p>

          <h3>The path of the member</h3>
          <p>
            In recent years, the membership path of the organization has been reviewed,
            and this year a concept was adopted based on more effective member engagement,
            the equal inclusion of curators, student representatives, programs, clubs,
            projects and long-term members in the ongoing processes on the basis of a
            culture of self-reflection. The aim of this concept is to pay more attention
            to the individual empowerment and involvement of each member in the organized
            activities. For each group of members (first members, curators,
            representatives of the SPC, long-term members) a specific concept of the
            membership path has been developed, taking into account the specifics of their
            work, the level of experience and competences.

            The Institutional Strengthening Fund is responsible for raising the
            competences of the organization members and managing human resources. The Fund
            aims to ensure the conditions for institutional strengthening and the
            consistent development of competences in the organization.
          </p>

            This year, the Institutional Strengthening Fund not only took care of the
            development of competences of the members of the organization, but also
            carried out the following projects:

              exit;
            </li>
            <li>
              And then there were regular meetings between the Institutional Strengthening
              Foundation and human resources coordinators (6 in total) to discuss topics
              relevant to the organization and its members:
