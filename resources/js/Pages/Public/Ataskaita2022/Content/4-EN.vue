                regarding the change in the funding of studies and study institutions for
                studies, supporting the aim to encourage not only the admission of as many

              <h4>Study program committees</h4>

              <p>
                Study Program Committees (SPC) are academic entities coordinating study
                programs and supervising their implementation. The SPC ensures the
                integrity of the objectives of the study program, the developed
                competencies, content, methods and assessments of student achievement and
                improves the study program by analyzing the opinion of students,
                lecturers, graduates, social partners and other indicators of the quality
                of the implementation of study programs. The SPC consists of at least 3
                lecturers, at least 1 social partner and at least 1 student
                representative.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to ensure effective representation of students in the SPC, the
                competences of student representatives were raised: central and
                departmental trainings were organized, where the students' representatives
                got acquainted with the activities of the SPC, the results of the
                collection of opinions and meetings in simulations, and the experience of
                other student representatives were familiarized. The students'
                representatives also took a test for them, which showed the level of their
                academic knowledge and gaps. During the reference period, student
                representatives collected students' opinions by questionnaire, virtual
                target groups or a mixed method, and the collected and systematized data
                were used and presented during the meetings of the SPC. During the SPC
                meetings, the issues of flexibility of studies, electives, content of
                subjects and updating of descriptions were most often discussed.

                  On 19th-21st of July, 10 delegates from VU SR participated in the UNICA
                  conference. This conference attracts hundreds of students from all
                  European countries. The main theme of the conference was the University
                  after the Covid-19 pandemic. Representatives of VU SR became involved in
                  different topics and working groups. The conference prepared letters,
                  positions on the development of universities after the pandemic. During
                  the conference, students from different European countries were met and
                  the European Student Union was introduced.

              <p>
                During the reference period, VU SR submitted proposals to the Law on
                Science and Studies no. Article XI-242,76, 82, 82(1) for the draft
                amendment and supplement of Article 82(2) aimed at establishing a basis
                for granting financial assistance to people with disabilities. The
                proposed corrections relate to improved accessibility of centralized
                support and the lack of change. Attention was also paid to the difference
                and impact of disabilities on studies, the inability to use part of the
                income to increase the accessibility of studies and the environment
                (teachers' education, infrastructure changes), and their allocation only
                with a certain level of capacity for work, without taking into account the
                collision of those with higher capacity for work with problems of similar
                thinking. It is proposed to provide financial support in the amount of
                8-18 basic social benefits (BSB), with a working capacity limit of 55% or
                more. In the light of the research carried out, it is proposed to abolish
                the condition for not receiving a scholarship in relation to academic
                achievement, specifically academic debts, since social assistance should
                be based on needs and social situation, not academic achievements.

                proposal to unify the requirements for those entering state-funded and
                unfunded places. However, aspects of taking into account the proper

                implementation of changes in order to reduce the difficulties caused by
                social exclusion in achieving admission requirements were highlighted. The

                I-1489 A draft law amending Articles 2, 11, 24, 38 and 47, which provides
                for changes to define and provide for projects which reduce the social
                dimension in higher education but which do not distribute support to less
                well-represented groups. The harmonization of the conditions for accession
                was accepted, but in the light of the recommendations made during the
                working groups of the European Higher Education Area, a remark was made to
                the existence of the definition of the social dimension in the law, noting
                the changing definition in the Bologna Process documents over the years.
                The proposed definition is given and it has been noted that most of the
                proposals were rejected due to their non-compliance with the principles of

            Experiences of the beginning of permanent studies of students from abroad at

          </h3>

          <p>
            The research was carried out between 5th of March, 2021, and 21st of March,
            2021, in cooperation with the Students' Representative Office of Kaunas
            University of Technology. The aim of the study was to clarify the problems of
            students during the distance learning period and to find out the factors that
            complicate integration into the academic community. About 40% of students said
            that when they started studying, the University did not provide enough
            information on study-related issues. Only 23% of respondents said that they
            received help from the university in the face of a lack of subject knowledge
            at the beginning of their studies. The rest try to eliminate the lack of
            knowledge themselves. The study also revealed that up to 40% of students
            experience difficulties in understanding lecturers or believe that the
            subjects they study are prepared superficially. More about the study can be

            Full-time international students’ experiences of arriving, studying, living in
            Lithuania: the perspective of students, experts and stakeholders
          </h3>

          <p>
            The survey was carried out between 1st of June, 2021, and 23rd of August,
            2021, in order to find out the negative experiences of foreign students who
            came to study for the entire study period in Lithuania and the difficulties
            they face. The research revealed that these students have many negative
            experiences when coming to Lithuania, because they are not considered
            equivalent residents of the country, and integration (both cultural and
            university) must take care of themselves due to insufficient assistance from
            the University. The university is distinguished by two communities of
            studying: local and foreign students. They do not receive enough opportunities
            to communicate with each other, which leads to a clear separation between
            these communities, both in terms of information from the University and in
            terms of opportunities to join the activities carried out. The main problems
            for foreign students are related to the long and complicated migration process
            in Lithuania and the unequal health care system. More about the study can be
            found here.

            Study of the conduct and quality assurance of student practices at and outside
            the University and beyond
          </h3>

          <p>
            The survey was carried out between 16th of August, 2021, and 24th of November,
            2021. The aim of the research was to review the problems of organizing the
            practices of Lithuanian higher education students and to find out the
            possibilities and emerging difficulties in ensuring and supervising the
            quality of the practices performed by students. During the study, it turned
            out that the opportunities for cooperation with the higher education sector
            are not used in the places of practice, and only a small part of the students'
            practice is based on the introduction of new competences and solutions into
            the practice institution. It is also evident that in the course of the
            internship process too little attention is paid to the preparation of the
            student to perform the internship, and the assessment of the practice depends
            not on the nature of the tasks performed and the activity, but on the report,
            course or final thesis prepared by the student. Such an assessment may show
            not the practical, but theoretical knowledge of the subject acquired. More

          <h3>Study of student scientific activities</h3>

          <p>
            The study was carried out between July and December in 2021. The aim of the
            research is to review the situation of students' scientific activities in
            Lithuanian universities and to identify why students are (not)involved in
            scientific activities, in what forms they can get involved and how this
            activity is observed in Lithuanian universities. The study showed that it is
            not possible to define exactly how many students are engaged in scientific
            activities and what measures should be taken to assess the situation due to
            the inaccurate definition of the concept of scientific activities of students.
            It is evident that students do not engage in scientific activities due to lack
            of time, lack of motivation or the attitude that they do not have sufficient
            knowledge of a particular field. Also, only a small percentage of
            undergraduate or master's students publish their works, and from the
            perspective of universities there is a lack of additional encouragement to
            engage in scientific activities. The most pressing problem observed was that
            neither universities (only 3 out of 10) nor state institutions monitor
            students' scientific activities, which leads to the fact that there is no
            research on the topic of scientific activities of students in Lithuania. More
            about the study can be found here.
          </p>

          <h3>Study of voluntary student scientific activities</h3>

          <p>
            According to a previous study of the scientific activities of students, a
            study was conducted to review what would encourage students to engage in
            voluntary scientific activities. The study found that students are more likely
            to engage in scientific activities when they value their studies and learning
            achievements well. One of the reasons why students do not engage in voluntary
            scientific activities is that students do not know where to turn in order to
            get involved and where they can carry out this activity. It is worth noting
            that although the financial incentive in the study was not statistically
            significant, the majority of respondents would support the idea of providing a
            financial incentive for those performing voluntary scientific activities,
            which would potentially reduce the appearance of a lack of time or motivation,
            since in this case students would not need to Looking for additional work.

          <h3>Overview of social dimension measures and their groups</h3>

          <p>
            The study was prepared during the autumn semester of 2021. The study reviews
            and discusses the most frequently mentioned plans for access to higher
            education in the European Higher Education Area. Based on the practice
            formulated by the existing plans, a methodology is proposed and formulated to
            define the barriers experienced by socially vulnerable groups in participation
            in higher education. More about the study can be found here.

          <p>
            The study was prepared during the spring semester of 2022. This study provides
            a further analysis of the groups of barriers and measures experienced by
            students previously presented. This study has implemented intelligence focus
            groups to provide examples in summarizing and clarifying the barriers faced by
            socially vulnerable people. There is also an overview of similar, broader
            studies, the methodology of which can be used to develop data and
            analysis-based solutions for the development of plans for access to higher
            education.

          <h3>Study of the integration of freshmen into the university</h3>

          <p>
            VU SR conducted a study on the integration of freshmen year students. The aim
            of the research is to find out the effectiveness of the activities carried out
            by VU and VU SR and involvement in the successful process of integration of
