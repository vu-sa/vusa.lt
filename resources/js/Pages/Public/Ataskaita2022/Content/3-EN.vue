            A working group has been set up to carry out analysis of VU study
            programs and foreign experiences on the flexibility of studies and
            the provision of academic support to students. A representative of
            students was delegated to the VU Internal Mobility Working Group,
            which coordinated the provisions of the 60 credit release model. In
            order to ensure academic assistance to students, a meeting with VU
            Student Affairs and Career Office (SACO) was organized to coordinate
            this issue. To introduce the community to more flexible study
            opportunities, we have created a podcast on this topic. Currently,
            we introduce student representatives to the Study Program Commitee
            (SPC) with the 60-credit release model, in cooperation with the
            SACO, we are creating a video about the flexibility of studies in VU
            Communication and Marketing Department.

              In cooperation with VU Psychological Counseling and Training
              Center (VU PCTC), the idea of an app designed to assess your
              psychological state has been transmitted. In cooperation with VU
              TSPMI administration, VU PCTC, VU Student Affairs and Career
              Office, a communication campaign was launched, a podcast was
              created, where students can recognize their psychological state
              and take care of it. The issue of improving the psychosocial
              environment and access to consultations was raised during the
              sittings of the Rectorate of VU and the VU Senate. Currently, VU
              TSPMI is looking for a psychologist for the community, and from
              September it is planned that a second academic consultant will
              appear at the institute.

              At the beginning of the school year, the coordinator of VU SA VM
              Students’ Scientific Society (SSS) was found and a job description
              for this position was created. Meetings were organized with VU VM
              administration staff, which were attended by the Chairman of VU SA
              VM and coordinator of VU SA VM SSS, and it was during these
              meetings that the ideas of the activities and implementation of VU
              SA VM SSS were improved. With the help of the administration,
              mentors are sought to help students carry out scientific
              activities.
