            <strong>MeDi</strong> is a traditional celebration of the Faculty of
            Medicine of Vilnius University, one of the oldest at Vilnius
            University, since 1783. This year, VU SA MF implemented a series of
            events focused on VU MF students, the VU community, the general
            public and its health education. This year's theme is addictions.
            The goal was achieved through public lectures and activities that
            were implemented in collaboration with various organizations,
            unions, and private companies. The entertainment was also not
            forgotten - the night orienteering and the night at the faculty
            brought the community closer together than ever before.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Fiesta personae</strong>, event of the Faculty of
            Philosophy, which is reborn every spring. This year, the phoenix of
            the Fiesta, together with the mysterious guest Fortune, brought the
            celebration back to life with the opening event of D.I.S.P.U.T.A.S,
            a delightful event of five different and diverse institutes and a
            closing concert of “Bard’s Evening”. As always, the newspaper "Bursa
            Yard" was published during the days of the Faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, the <strong>Mercury Days</strong> organized by VU SA EVAF
            delighted us with the car orienteering competition, the “Be
            Satisfied with Mercury’22” eating competition and the quiz following
            them, the evening of team games and the closing concert of “Even
            with Mercury’22”. The events were designed to promote the community
            spirit of the students through activities that reduce social
            exclusion and promote interaction. One of the methods used to
            achieve these goals was the translation of event activities,
            information and games into English and the active integration of
            foreign students. Also, during the activities, the skills of
            teamwork, problem solving, analytical and critical thinking of
            students were developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year’s <strong>TeDi’22 (Lawyers ’Day)</strong> Opening
            Conference sailed into international waters. At the event,
            specialists and legal experts explored the topic of "Russia's war
            against Ukraine: law, geopolitics and morality". The event was held
            online, in English. The second "How It Was" event denied the
            stereotype that the law lives only in a court, prosecutor's office,
            law firm or other legal institution. The third event “Auction” gives
            all participants the opportunity to purchase both items belonging to
            VU TF lecturers and to experience unforgettable moments together
            with the faculty lecturers. Among the founders of the prizes are not
            only VU TF lecturers, but also the Mayor of Vilnius - Remigijus
            Šimašius. The fourth event, "From generation to generation with VU
            TF Alumni" - the idea, the aim to have a warm and cozy conversation
            with people who shared their memories of studying times, but also
            insights and advice that are relevant to our young community,
            discussed issues of concern. related to study or career topics. The
            final conference of VU TF Students’ Scientific Society this year
            brought together Vilnius University law and other researchers,
            students and other legal science enthusiasts to provide an
            opportunity to review the innovativeness of this year's students in
            the relationship between interdisciplinary fields and law. It is the
            culmination of a six-month event in which the 6 teams selected by
            the competent commission to write the best scientific article
            presented their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>56th Chemists' Days</strong>, held at the beginning of the
            school year, on September 16th-18th. Through them, VU SA CHGF
            organized public laboratory works and colorful chemical shows, which
            gave the public a closer look at chemistry and the wonders that can
            be seen in it, thus proving that everyone can and should enjoy the
            wonderful science of chemistry. Also, a bowling tournament and a BBQ
            evening were held for the community of the unit - the events showed
            that different generations, even those who have already graduated,
            can communicate well, have a good time and build a future together!

                  As every year, VU SR continues the tradition of organizing
                  camps focused on the integration process of first-year
                  students. In August, before starting studies at Vilnius
                  University, 18 first-year camps of VU SR were organized, which
                  were attended by more than 1,100 future VU students. As the
                  epidemiological situation continued, several-day outreach
                  camps were abandoned and replaced by shorter one-day camps in
                  the departments and units of the Botanical Garden of Vilnius
                  University. During the camps, the first-year students got
                  acquainted with the University and University’s culture,
                  lecturers, alumni and departmental administrations, learned
                  about the study process and the study environment. VU SR
                  activities, programs, clubs and projects as well as students'
                  opportunities at the University were also presented.

                  The curator's program is a program implemented by VU SR since
                  2000, designed to effectively integrate first-year students
                  into the University community and acquaint them with the study
                  process. Participants in this program - tutors - are senior
                  students who have received special training and help the
                  students in their supervised group during the integration
                  process. For the second year in a row, this program has
                  expanded its field of activity and has begun to focus on
                  first-year master's students and full-time students from
                  abroad, who enter the community in the same way as first-year
                  undergraduate students. They get help from mentors who have
                  received special training. This year, the curators program
                  attracted more than 200 curators who took care of the
                  integration of students into the University and contributed to
                  the implementation of the first-year students’ camps and the
                  first week of integration week.

            VU Debate club – a club, established 2004, to promote communication
            between students representing different faculties, to provide space
            to develop critical thinking, reasoning, English and public speaking
            skills, and to represent the Vilnius University in tournaments.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2019 the club was inactive, but this year the enterprising group
            of students gathered and was actively preparing for the return of
            the club. First, the qualifications were raised and the search and
            selection process was carried out in the process of creating the
            final council. Secondly, after the preliminary creation of the
            Council, weekly meetings were held to raise qualifications and a
            general decision on the future of VU Debate club, activities and
            technical issues. Thirdly, after the necessary qualifications have
            been achieved, the council and the activities of the Debate Society
            have been finally formed, and in cooperation with the VU Students’
            Representative Office (a logo was created, organizational and
            technical issues were solved, and the marketing activities carried
            out and etc.) was prepared for the opening of the Society. Other
            non-profit debate organizations, such as The Youth Debate, has also
            cooperated on this issue. Finally, the VU Debate Society was

            three-day camp is organized by VU SR for students of older classes
            who want to get acquainted with student life and study
            opportunities. This year, the camp was organized face-to-face – due
            to the prevailing pandemic situation in Lithuania, this project was
            transferred to Discord platform for two years in a row. This year's
            SMMS camp took place at the General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy
            of Lithuania, with which we have been cooperating for several years.
            It is very interesting that in such circumstances the project
            managed to attract more than 100 students from all over Lithuania
            and give them the opportunity to see Vilnius University, its
            activities and, together with the curators-students, to feel true
            students in the chosen academic core units for at least a day. This

          </p>

          <p>
            This year's main event VU Career Days 2022 was organized on March

            running of the entire project. The biggest changes of this year
            project are the organization of additional events, the inclusion of
            members during almost the entire reporting period and the
            organization of individual events of VU Career Days in VU academic
            core units that are located outside of Vilnius. The initiative that
            we are most proud of is the Hackathon, during which student teams

            “Be etikečių” - VU SR has been implementing a program active in the
            field of reduction of social exclusion and human rights since 2010.
            This program aims to promote respect in the VU community, break
            established stereotypes and increase the University's openness by
            promoting the full integration of socially vulnerable groups. The
            core values of the program are: equality, openness and respect for
            the individuality of each person.
          </p>

          <p>
            This year, Be etikečių, was focused on individual socially
            vulnerable groups. 4 cycles of events and projects were organized:
            LGBTQ+ Culture Festival Kultūra visų, Feminism Week, Disability Week
            and Ethnic Minority Month. Each of these thematic cycles was aimed
            at delving into the experiences of the group represented in it, to
            introduce both its achievements and problems, to provide a platform
            for the representatives(s) of that group to talk about the aspects
            of everyday life and activism that are important to them and them.
            The traditions of the program were also continued: in September Be
            etikečių marched at the Lithuanian LGBTQ+ pride march, held for the
            first time in Kaunas; for the fourth time Halloween was celebrated
            in the debate on the stigmatization of psychological disorders in
            Halofobija; continuing the long-standing cooperation with the
            University's LGBT+ group, a discussion was held on the situation of
            LGBTQ+ rights in Lithuania and Europe.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2021, the program's style book was updated and communication on
            social media was changed accordingly: the transition was made from
            educational content for people who are not exposed to almost
            completely socially vulnerable groups, to deeper texts that require
            a certain previous acquaintance with the topic presented from the
            audience, as well as an effort was made to respond meaningfully to
            current issues. A series of recordings #KulturaVisu was continued,
            presenting to readers artists from socially vulnerable groups of
            different directions, and it was supplemented by a new project
            #DragZodynelis, the recordings of which introduce the terms and
            history of drag culture.

            Vilnius University Kendo Club is a Japanese fencing studio of VU SR,
            which has been operating since 2008, designed for both beginners and
            those who want to improve their already existing skills. Kendo Club
            seeks not only to promote kendo sports and promote active lifestyle,
            but also to bring together students interested in Japanese martial
            arts, to promote the name of Vilnius University in Lithuania and the

            During the reference period, the club participated in a contact fair
            for freshmen. Due to the pandemic situation in the country, the
            club, in compliance with safety requirements, was unable to conduct
            training and participate in competitions. Nevertheless, the studio
            representatives presented the possibilities of solo and paired
            training to their followers on social media and invited everyone to
            play sports.

            The Students’ Life Guide (SGV) is a publication of VU SR designed to
            facilitate the beginning of the life of freshmen and students coming
            from abroad to Vilnius University to study in a new city (or
            country). The main goal of the SGV is to promote students'
            independence, activities and, of course, to ensure smooth
            integration into the ranks of the largest academic community in
            Lithuania. In order to achieve this goal as efficiently as possible,
            it is ensured that the publication reaches students no longer in the
            form of a book, but in the form of a website sgv.vusa.lt for the
            second year. For this reason, SGV can be not only a source of
            information at the beginning of the year, but also throughout the
            year of study, since in this publication you can find all the
            necessary information related to the most important processes,
            services and leisure time of the University.

            VU Writers Club - a society uniting VU students who are writing and
            interested in literature was formed in 2013. The goal of the VU
            Writers Club is not only to bring together writers, but also to
            encourage more interest in literature, to look at it from the side
            of the creator, critic, reader and listener.
          </p>

          <p>
            Members of the VU Writers Club organize open lectures on the most
            interesting literary movements and the most prominent creators of
            world and Lithuanian literature, organize reading events of their
            works, organize meetings with writers, organize reviews and
            discussions of films based on literary works, communicate with
            actors.
          </p>

          <p>
            This year, the VU Writers Club paid a lot of attention to public
            education: since January, 2022, it was actively started to publish
            texts and visual material about various representatives of
            Lithuanian and world art fields, prominent personalities on the
            Instagram account, which was a great success. We started to share
            the works of Lithuanian poets in story format, we published more
            detailed essay articles on Facebook account. After the outbreak of
            the war in Ukraine, we translated and shared the works of Ukrainian
            poets on social networks every day, and in cooperation with the VU
            Young Journalists Organization, we read Ukrainian poetry during the
            debate. We also collaborated with the Be etikečių program to prepare
            and evaluate the competition Metamorphoses: the intersection of
            ethnic identities as a starting point for changes in society for
            students in grades 9-12.

            During the reporting period, one of the most important tasks of the

          <h4>VU Photography Club</h4>

            >During the reference period, VU Photography Club was coordinated by

          <p>
            The mission of VU Photography Club is to foster and mature the
            diversity and creativity of students through one of the most
            fascinating art directions – photography. However, this year we
            realized that our mission is also inseparable from constant
            cooperation with Vilnius University. We are happy to get the
            opportunity to provide photography services to such a wide variety
            of programs, clubs and projects and to be able to capture the
            stories of the University.
          </p>

          <p>
            This year, our activities focused on 3 main areas: members, VU
            community and society.
          </p>

          <p>
            We tried to create a community for club members, where both
            photographers, enthusiasts and advanced professionals interested in
            photography could spend time together and share experiences. During
            both semesters, we organized activities in groups where we carried
            out trainings and various practical classes. At the end of the fall
            semester, we organized our first live photography exhibition
            "Change" in the corridor of the VU Rectorate. For many members of
            the club, this was the first photography exhibition in which they
            were proud of their work. We also met for the first time with the
            members of Photography club alumni, from whom we took inspiration
            for further activities. We have repeatedly carried out activities
            dedicated to the members in two languages, involving foreign
            students interested in the club.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have provided photography services to the VU community almost
            everywhere and always. As the spring semester draws to a close, we
            no longer even know where to put the photos captured during this
            year alone, because our storage is constantly filling up. As they
            say, "sharing is caring". Guided by this idea, we organized two open
            training courses on the basics of photography for the VU community.
          </p>

          <p>
            After all, we have always tried to remain social and active in
            public. We have constantly recorded all sorts of shots – from the
            brightest public holidays to the most painful protests. We have
            remained indifferent and responsible together with the entire VU SR.
          </p>

          <p>
            We thank Vilnius University and VU SR as a whole for their
            uninterrupted cooperation, close connection and opportunities to
            grow, act and thrive.

            This year, the club organized informal meetings of members, during
            which the club members were given the opportunity to discuss their
            own research and scientific activities. We filmed episodes of our
            podcast Second Conversations (you can find them on our Facebook
            page). There was also an event I'm Gay. I'm a lesbian. VU students'

            involve as many Lithuanian educational institutions, journalistic
            circles as possible and young people interested in individual
            journalism in the project. The information partners have already

            field. We constantly receive offers to come to events of other
            organizations, to get involved in projects of various genres. For
            example, in April 2022, our member Ūla Klimaševska contributed to
            the journalistic investigation "Jonas and the General: What Links
            Jonas Pinskus and Russia" conducted by the Centre for Investigative

            JŽD members. In the near future, we will pay more attention to the
            deeper integration of members, strengthening of the
            interconnectedness (in May, mind battle, other social type events
            are organized), we will try to reach more creative Lithuanian
            schoolchildren who can reveal their potential within the framework
            of the organization. A creative camp is planned for summer-autumn,
            we are already considering the autumn season discussions and public
            events on the most relevant topics with people operating in
            Lithuania and the international space. We will continue to carry out
            the organization of the Prize with the most professional journalists

          <h4>New initiatives</h4>
          <p>
            During the reference period, the aim was to significantly expand and
            increase the network of student initiatives. To achieve this goal, a
            “hackVU” event was organized, during which several new initiatives
            were added to our community. The first steps were also started by
            several other initiatives – mind battles, music club.

            support fund “Ateičiai”, which is dedicated to the well-being of
            Vilnius University students. The foundation was established to
            represent the diverse needs of students.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the reference period, the charity and support fund
            “Ateičiai”, distributing merchandise in both physical and electronic
            stores, publicized and promoted the name of Vilnius University. This
            year, one-day pop-up shops were also organized in various academic
            core units of the University, and students were given the
            opportunity to purchase merch during the events taking place at the
            University. In addition, Fund is expanding cooperation with the
            University – a cooperation agreement has been signed with VU Museum
            on the sale of their products in the VU merchandise shop (postcards,
            magnets, etc.). This year the fund is also continues to collect 1.2%
            income tax support, which will be purposefully used for the
            integration into the University of Ukrainian students. The funds
            collected will be used to purchase the necessary household items,
            hygiene products or goods intended for the visiting students(s) and
            necessities to ensure the quality of a study process. Last year,
            support was also collected, and in the current situation in Ukraine,
            it was decided to allocate the collected support to the integration
            of Ukrainian students who had arrived into the VU community and to
            improve their living conditions in Lithuania.
