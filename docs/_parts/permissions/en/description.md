Permissions are used to grant access to a part of the page, once the user
is logged in.

Permissions are usually related to objects - institutions, goals, etc.,
and by assigning these permissions to a role, they allow to perform
certain actions.

Permissions can also have a scope, i.e.: 'own', division or the whole
platform.
