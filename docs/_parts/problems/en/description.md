Problems are challenges, obstacles, or questions that you or your team encounter in your work. They may be related to communication, processes, technical issues, resource constraints, or any other area that needs attention and resolution.

Why is this useful?

- A shared knowledge base of solutions is created.
- Knowledge is shared with other units.
- Duplicate solutions to the same problem are avoided.

How it works:

1. Log the problem when it occurs.
2. Add details.
3. Log the solution when the problem is resolved.
4. Filter and review problems.
