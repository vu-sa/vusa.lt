# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is vusa.lt/mano? Why do I need this platform and why should I use it?

My VU SR (or vusa.lt/mano) is VU SR's internal platform for members. The platform is designed to facilitate and streamline the processes and communication between representatives, coordinators, and other VU SR members.

This comprehensive platform allows you to manage meetings, tasks, resources, and internal processes of VU SR. It helps with reporting on meetings of the SPC, CAU Council, Board of Studies or other committees and bodies, and tracking issues discussed during those meetings.

Also, it contributes to institutional memory, as members will be able to review past activities, decisions, and discussions, ensuring continuity and effectiveness of VU SR's work.
