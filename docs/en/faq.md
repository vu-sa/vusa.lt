# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is vusa.lt/mano? Why do I need this platform and why should I use it?

ViSAK (or vusa.lt/mano) is the virtual coordinator of the students’ representatives. The platform is designed to facilitate and streamline the processes and communication between representatives and coordinators. 

This IT tool allows you to easily report on meetings of the SPC, CAU Council, Board of Studies or other committees and bodies, and on issues discussed during those meetings. 

Also, it contributes to institutional memory, as the next students’ representative(s) will be able to review in the future what issues have been discussed previously and return or raise new issues in one or another University’s body.  

## What are the main features I need and how do I use them?  

On this platform you can report on the meeting, upload the agenda, protocols/ reports, report on the votes taken and indicate whether the decision taken was in favour of the student(s) or not, or if the issue was not relevant to the student(s).   

You can report on the meeting by selecting the representation function in the system. First, click on the "Report a meeting" button, then select the appropriate institution for the meeting, add the agenda items and click on "Submit".    

By selecting the "Show all" button, you can see all your meetings that will take place in the near future that you have notified in the system. If you select a specific meeting, you can see the agenda items you have specified and add files: protocols and reports, mark the results of votes for each question on the agenda

### I have received information about an e-meeting (voting by email): what is it and what should I do?  
 
An e-meeting is a meeting that takes place electronically, usually by voting on one or more issues by email. An e-meeting is equivalent to any other meeting, so when you receive information about an e-meeting, it is important to familiarize yourself with the information you have been sent and to remember to cast your vote before the deadline. This meeting should also be marked on the vusa.lt/mano platform like other meetings, indicating the outcome of the vote on the issue(s) in question.

### Who should take the minutes if we have more than one representative on the SPC?  

Agree amongst yourselves who is responsible for writing a report of the meeting and uploading the protocol/report to vusa.lt/mano.  

### What is the protocol of a meeting? The report from the students’ representative(s)? 

The protocol of a meeting is an official document prepared by the secretary of the meeting, which describes all the issues discussed and the resolutions adopted.   
 
Students’ Representative's report - a document that also describes the issues and resolutions discussed during the meeting but supplemented by the students' perspective, the main ideas and issues expressed by the members of the body.   
 
In some cases where the official protocols are not sent to the members of the body after the meeting, the report prepared by the students' representative(s) corresponds to the protocol. 

### How do I publicize my activities as a students’ representative?

After the meeting, share information about the work done and decisions taken with the students in your study program(s). You can do this by using the contact persons or by sending a letter via the mailing list and other means.

## How to collect the opinion of the student(s)?  

### What are the ways to collect opinions? 

Students’ opinions can be collected by organizing a focus group, by conducting an online survey, by communicating with students in your course or in other courses, or by analizing the results of the VU IS semester surveys. It is important that the data collected is valid and reliable in order to argue the position of the students. It is important to inform and consult with the coordinator of the representatives at your unit before initiating the collection of students' opinions. 

### How to organize a focus group? 

To organize a focus group, it is necessary to clarify the purpose(s) of the opinion gathering, to gather a group of people (it should be as diverse as possible because of the possible different opinions of the students). The optimal number of participants is between 6 and 10. The duration should not exceed 2 hours.   
 
When moderating the focus group, do not forget to identify who you are, the purpose of the opinion gathering and what will be done with the gathered opinion later. Ask questions that stimulate discussion, listen (you should not participate in the debate). Write down the most important ideas. If you see a need, you can record the meeting for later analysis but do not forget to give notice to the participants and get their consent.  
 
Don't forget to check the focus group questions with your coordinator beforehand!

### How to organize a survey? 

Setting up a survey also requires clarifying the purpose of the survey, formulating targeted questions to avoid questions that are not relevant to the survey. Also check beforehand whether students’ opinions have been collected on this topic before (you can ask a previous students’ representative or your unit’s coordinator).  
 
Also in the survey, inform the students of what will be done with the collected opinion. Share the survey through different communication channels (contact persons, student mailing lists, etc.) taking into account the targeted audience.  
 
Don't forget to check the survey questions with your coordinator before launching it!  

### What to do with the data collected? 

Analyse the data collected, map and highlight the most relevant issues for the students. Once the problems have been identified, arguments should be developed and possible solutions considered. This data, the issues and possible solutions can be presented during the meeting for discussion with other members of the body.

## Possible situations and solutions

### Committee members did not take into account the students' opinions, what to do? 

If decisions have been made that are not in favour of the students’, or if the students have not been consulted during the meeting, inform the coordinator of your unit as soon as possible and work together on a plan to resolve the problem. 

### I was not informed about the meeting... 

Inform the coordinator of the representatives, contact the administrator who sends out the information about the meeting, the chairperson of the SPC or some other unit, and remind them that they have to inform and invite you. If you missed the meeting because of this and were unable to attend, ask for the protocol of the meeting.  

### I have not received the agenda or the documents to be approved at the meeting in advance... 

Ask the chairperson or secretary of the body to send you the relevant information - agenda items, documents - in advance. If you still have not received them, you can ask for time to read them or postpone the questions during the meeting in order to have a thorough look at the documents, or to gather the opinion of the students on one or other issue. 

### What if you are treated disrespectfully during a meeting? 

Draw members' attention to this behavior, pointing out that it is inappropriate in the academic community of the University, and try to maintain respectful communication yourself. If the members do not respond to the request, you may contact the coordinator of the representatives or other members of the administration after the meeting. If the behavior during the meeting was particularly inappropriate and in breach of academic ethics, contact the Academic Ethics Commission in the unit.  

### What if I don't know what the students think about an issue, and I don't have an argument ready? 

If you become aware of an issue before the meeting, you should gather what the opinion and position should be on the issue. If it is the first time you hear it at a meeting, you can ask for the issue to be moved to the next meeting or to a voting by email, indicating that you would like to ask students about it.

### Meetings have not been organized for a very long time. Can I call a meeting myself? 

If the chairperson of the SPC does not call a meeting, any two other members of the committee can initiate one, so the students’ representative can call a meeting with another member of the committee, or with another students’ representative (if there are more than one students’ representatives in the body), to discuss the issues. 

### In the meeting the approval of a document will be discussed. What if I don't know if it is in order? 

Send the documents approved by the various bodies to the VU SR U coordinator of the representatives or the Academic Affairs for review and they will help you to check whether all the points in the document are correct or whether anything needs to be adjusted.
