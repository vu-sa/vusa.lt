# Reservation system

The Reservation System and its resources are managed by VU SR U and student initiative administrators. In their absence, responsibility for the system lies with other individuals delegated by the VU SR U or the student initiative leader.

## ðŸŽ¯ Resource Management Agreements
- The resource database is updated twice a year: by 1 August and 1 March of the current year.
- When uploading information about items, it is important to provide the exact name, a clear and detailed description, one or more photos of the item, the exact quantity, and indicate whether the item is available for reservation or borrowing.
- All items owned by the unit must be added to the system, regardless of whether they are available for borrowing or not.
- All resource information (name, description, etc.) must be provided in both Lithuanian and English.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reservation Procedure Agreements

- Item(s) must be reserved at least 7 working days before the event or training session.
- In the title field, indicate the exact name of the event or training.
- In the description, provide all relevant details â€“ the purpose of the items, when you plan to collect them, and who will be collecting them.
- Reservation period â€“ specify the exact time frame during which you intend to borrow the items.
- In the resources section, you may select items and quantities from all units at once â€“ there is no need to create separate reservations. Items may be borrowed from VU SR CB, VU SR U, and VU SR student initiatives.
- In the additional information section, confirm that you take full responsibility for returning the items on time, maintaining their condition, and covering any damage caused.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reservation Management Agreements
- Upon receiving a reservation request, the resource manager (either VU SR U or VU SR student initiative administrator, as well as other assigned persons) must approve or reject the request within 1â€“2 working days.
- In the comments section, specify when the item will be ready for collection, and provide contact details of the person responsible for handing it over.
- Upon arrival to collect the item, no additional signature is required for the item handover, as the handover form is digital. By making the reservation, the individual agrees to the terms and conditions.
