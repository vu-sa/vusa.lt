## Common questions

### ðŸŽ¯ What is vusa.lt/mano?

My VU SR (also known as vusa.lt/mano) is VU SR's internal platform, designed to streamline and optimize the work of all VU SR members, including student representatives, administrators, coordinators and student initiative leaders. The platform ensures efficient processes, effective communication, and easy access to information and resources.

### ðŸ’¡ Why is it worth using My VU SR?

âœ… More effective resource management and administration;
âœ… Clearer communication between coordinators from different fields;
âœ… Easy access to important information and documents;

### ðŸŽ¯ How can administrators and coordinators use this platform?

#### ðŸ”¹ Reservation System (Item Booking)

VU SR U and student initiative administrators can easily reserve necessary items, such as equipment, promotional materials, or other resources. This allows for more efficient planning, helps avoid duplication, and ensures the rational distribution of shared assets.

Thanks to this system, each organiser from VU SR U or a student initiative can save resources by avoiding unnecessary purchases when the required items are already available from other VU SR units. In addition, it provides a clear overview of who is using which resources and when, reducing errors and minimising the risk of items being lost or misplaced.

#### ðŸ”¹ Document Browser (Administration, Transparency, and Public Access)

My VU SR enables the management, upload, and publication of various documents â€“ including protocols from different bodies, reports, and other important materials. This contributes to transparency and ensures easy access to information for all relevant stakeholders.

The document administration feature allows for the centralised collection and organisation of information, while also ensuring that essential documents are easily accessible to those who need them. This is particularly important for promoting openness and smooth collaboration between different VU SR units and student initiatives.
 
#### ðŸ”¹ Calendars

The platform allows for the publication of agendas, the organisation of general meetings, and the provision of easy access to all essential information. This supports effective coordination and smooth communication among VU SR units.

A centralised calendar enables better activity planning, helps avoid scheduling conflicts, and ensures that all relevant individuals are informed about upcoming meetings. Additionally, this feature enhances collaboration and work coordination across various VU SR units.

## Reservation System

### ðŸŽ¯ Can only VU SR U and student initiative administrators make item reservations?

Any VU SR U or student initiative coordinator can make an item reservation. However, only a VU SR U or student initiative administrator has the right to approve the reservation.

### ðŸŽ¯ What time period should be indicated when reserving an item?

When reserving an item, it is recommended to specify the exact time you plan to pick up the item and the exact date and time you plan to return it. The more precise the information provided, the less additional communication will be needed.

### ðŸŽ¯ If a reservation has already been approved, can it be cancelled due to a change in circumstances?

Currently, the system does not support cancellation of approved reservations. If you have approved a resource that can no longer be borrowed, you should leave a comment indicating that the reservation is cancelled and personally inform the requester.

### ðŸŽ¯ When adding a new item, is it necessary to include a photo, English description, and other details?

Yes. When uploading new items to the system, you must include a photo, a detailed description, and provide all information in English, regardless of whether your unit or initiative currently involves international students.

### ðŸŽ¯ What should I do if an item is found to be damaged before, during, or after the event?

If you notice that an item is damaged, you should first inform the VU SR unit or student initiative administrator (or, in their absence, the VU SR U or initiative leader). Then you should discuss whether any compensation for damages is necessary.

### ðŸŽ¯ Is there a limit to how many items we can borrow?

There is no set limit â€“ you may borrow as many items as are available in the system.

## Document Browser

### ðŸŽ¯ What types of documents should be uploaded to the Document Browser?

The following documents should be uploaded:

- VU SR U Statutes
- VU SR U Interim and Annual Reports
- VU SR U Annual Activity Plans
- VU SR U Protocols from Reporting-Electoral, Extraordinary Electoral, and Extraordinary Reporting-Electoral Conventions
- Protocols of the Collegial Governance Body (CGB) (Board / in the case of VU SR MIF â€“ the Council)

### ðŸŽ¯ If there are no international students in our unit, do we still need to upload documents in English?

If your unit does not include international students, it is not mandatory to upload documents in English. However, if your unit does include international students, you are expected to upload bilingual documents â€“ in both Lithuanian and English.

### ðŸŽ¯ Can anyone upload documents to the Document Browser?

In principle, any VU SR U coordinator can upload documents, but this task is primarily assigned to VU SR U administrators.

### ðŸŽ¯ Are student initiatives of VU SR also required to upload documents to the site?

Currently, due to technical limitations, only VU SR units can upload documents to vusa.lt.

### ðŸŽ¯ What should I do if I find a mistake in a document that has already been uploaded?

If you discover an error in an uploaded document, you should delete the file from the VU SR Archive, make the necessary corrections, and upload the updated version. The document must then be properly formatted according to technical requirements and re-uploaded to the website.

### ðŸŽ¯ How many documents can be uploaded to the Document Browser at once?

You can upload up to 20 documents at a time.

### ðŸŽ¯ What file formats are accepted for uploading to the website?

- For protocols from general meetings, curators', coordinators', or collegial governance body sessions, documents must be uploaded to both the Archive and the website in .pdf format (The Archive may contain both final and editable versions).
- For templates, .docx and other file formats may be used when uploading to the website.
