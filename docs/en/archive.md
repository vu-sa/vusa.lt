# VU SR archive

The VU SR Archive is overseen by VU SR U and student initiative administrators. In their absence, responsibility lies with other individuals delegated by VU SR U or the head of a student initiative.

The VU SR Archive is a repository where all essential information about the activities of the Vilnius University Students' Representation is collected and preserved. It stores documents, photographs, videos, and other records that illustrate how students engaged in activities, addressed issues, organised events, and represented the University community throughout different periods.

The purpose of the Archive is to safeguard the history of VU SR and ensure that important information is not lost or forgotten. It serves not only as a means of remembering past student life but also as a valuable resource for current and future members to learn from experience and carry forward ongoing initiatives.
